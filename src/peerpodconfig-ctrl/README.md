# peerpodconfig-ctrl
peerpodconfig-ctrl is a kubernetes controller which is responsible for
watching the PeerPodConfig CRD object and manages the creation and deletion
lifecycle of all required components to run peer pods.

## Description
This controller can be run standalone or imported into existing operators. It comes with
a CRD called PeerPodConfig that it's watching. By creating an instance of PeerPodConfig the deployment of
cloud-api-adaptor daemonset and the webhook is triggered, extended resources are advertised by
updating the node capacity fields.

### PeerPodConfig CRD
The PeerPodConfig let's the user specify the number of peer pod vms that can be deployed.
It is spread as evenly as possible across the number of nodes.

## Integrate with your operator
Running the peerpodconfig-ctrl as another controller embedded into an operator can be easily
done. Import the controller into your operators main.go and start it.

For an operator-sdk generated operator it could be as simple as:

```go
    import (
        ...
        peerpodcontrollers "github.com/confidential-containers/cloud-api-adaptor/src/peerpodconfig-ctrl/controllers"
        peerpodconfig "github.com/confidential-containers/cloud-api-adaptor/src/peerpodconfig-ctrl/api/v1alpha1"
        ...
    )

    func init() {
        ...
        utilruntime.Must(peerpodconfig.AddToScheme(scheme))
        ...
    }

    func main() {
	...
        if err = (&peerpodcontrollers.PeerPodConfigReconciler{
        	Client: mgr.GetClient(),
        	Log:    ctrl.Log.WithName("controllers").WithName("RemotePodConfig"),
        	Scheme: mgr.GetScheme(),
        }).SetupWithManager(mgr); err != nil {
        	setupLog.Error(err, "unable to create RemotePodConfig controller for OpenShift cluster", "controller", "RemotePodConfig")
        	os.Exit(1)
        }
        ...
    }
```

## Getting Started
Please note that while it is possible to run the controller standalone it is not the
intended use case. 

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/peerpodconfig-ctrl:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/peerpodconfig-ctrl:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
