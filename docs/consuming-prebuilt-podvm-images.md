# Consuming pre-built podvm images

The project has automation in place to build container images that contain the qcow2 file for the various Linux distributions and cloud providers supported. Those images are re-built for each release of this project.

You can find the images available at https://quay.io/organization/confidential-containers with the *podvm-[generic|vsphere]-[DISTRO]-[ARCH]* name pattern.

For example:
- https://quay.io/repository/confidential-containers/podvm-generic-ubuntu-amd64 hosts the Ubuntu images that can be used with all providers (except vsphere).
- https://quay.io/repository/confidential-containers/podvm-vsphere-ubuntu-amd64 hosts the Ubuntu images that can be used with vsphere provider.
- https://quay.io/repository/confidential-containers/podvm-generic-ubuntu-s390x hosts the Ubuntu images that can be used for s390x architecture.
- https://quay.io/repository/confidential-containers/podvm-generic-centos-amd64 hosts the CentOS images that can be used with all providers (except vsphere).

>Note: images for CentOS Stream haven't been built since the release 0.8.0 of this project.

The easiest way to extract the qcow2 file from the podvm container image is using the [`download-image.sh`](../podvm/hack/download-image.sh) script. For example, to extract the file from the *podvm-generic-ubuntu-amd64* image:

```
$ cd podvm
$ ./hack/download-image.sh quay.io/confidential-containers/podvm-generic-ubuntu-amd64 . -o podvm.qcow2
```

In case your workload images are pulled from a private registry then you need to provide the authentication file by either [installing along with the cloud-api-adaptor deployment](registries-authentication.md#deploy-authentication-file-along-with-cloud-api-adaptor-deployment) or [statically embedding in the podvm image](registries-authentication.md#statically-embed-authentication-file-in-podvm-image). With the later you will need to build the image from sources, so find detailed instructions in [podvm/README.md](../podvm/README.md).
