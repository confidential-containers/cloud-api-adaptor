# Importing Public PODVM images into IBM Cloud VPC

As part of the release process pre-built images are published as container images to the confidential-containers quay repository. e.g. `quay.io/confidential-containers/podvm-ibmcloud-ubuntu-s390x` that contain a single qcow2 file that can be extracted. Alternatively images can be built and distributed directly as qcow2 files. These qcow2 that needs to be uploaded to ibmcloud to use as a vpc image. 

To simpify this process a script has been created to aid this. `ibmcloud/image/import.sh`.

## Prerequisites

### Tools

- jq `apt install jq`
- ibmcloud `curl -fsSL https://clis.cloud.ibm.com/install/linux | sh` (https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started)
- docker/podman `apt install docker.io`    
It's failed to install `docker` on Ubuntu20.04 with above single command. `docker` can be installed with `snap` as below.
    ```
    sudo snap install docker
    sudo systemctl start snap.docker.dockerd
    sudo systemctl enable snap.docker.dockerd
    ```

### Cloud-Object-Storage

To create the VPC image you need to first import the file to ibmcloud COS. The script will do this step but a bucket must already be available.

You may follow the [offical documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started-cloud-object-storage) to create a bucket, a free tier is sufficient. Bucket region can be different from the VPC region.

## Running
```
Usage: ./import.sh <docker-image/qcow2-file> <vpc-region> [--bucket <name> --region <cos-region> --instance <cos-instance> --endpoint <cos-endpoint> --api <cloud-endpoint> --os <operating-system>]
```

### Arguments

The first two arguments are positional:

1. The name of the container image to extract the qcow2 file, or the file itself
1. The VPC region to create the image in (the process can be repeated for multiple regions)

The later options:

- `instance`: the cos instance name. Required if the cli has not been configured with the cos instance before
- `bucket`: name of the bucket to use. Will use an available bucket if not specified
- `region`: name of the region the bucket is in. Only required if that region is different from the VPC region
- `endpoint`: the COS endpoint to upload to. Optional, but required if using staging, where the endpoint can be found in the 'Configuration' tab in the COS bucket page of the IBM Cloud UI.
- `os`: name of the operating-system for the image, will default to `ubuntu-20-04-<< image-suffix >>` e.g. `ubuntu-20-04-s390x`. The HyperProtect OS is `hyper-protect-1-0-s390x`.

The script will sanitise `.` and `_` into `-` and lowercase the image name. Only lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens only (without spaces) are allowed for image names. If your image file name contains other special characters please rename it before attempting to import.

> **Note:** If uploading to IBM Cloud staging, you will first need to set the API endpoint with `export IBMCLOUD_API_ENDPOINT=https://test.cloud.ibm.com`.

### Examples

- Extracting and uploading a qcow2 image from a container image:

`./import.sh quay.io/confidential-containers/podvm-ibmcloud-ubuntu-s390x ca-tor --instance jt-cos-instance --bucket podvm-image-cos-bucket-jt --region jp-tok`

- Uploading a qcow2 file directly:

`./import.sh podvm.qcow2 ca-tor --instance jt-cos-instance --bucket podvm-image-cos-bucket-jt --region jp-tok`

- Uploading a SE qcow2 file directly:

`./import.sh se-image-2.qcow2 eu-gb --os hyper-protect-1-0-s390x`
