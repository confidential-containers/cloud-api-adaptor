# Options for analysis running.
run:
  # The default concurrency value is the number of available CPU.
  #concurrency: 4

  # Timeout for analysis, e.g. 30s, 5m.
  # Default: 1m
  timeout: 5m

  # Exit code when at least one issue was found.
  # Default: 1
  #issues-exit-code: 2

  # Include test files or not.
  # Default: true
  #tests: false

  # List of build tags, all linters use it.
  # Default: [].
  build-tags:
    - aws
    - ibmcloud
    - libvirt
    - azure

  # Which dirs to skip: issues from them won't be reported.
  # Can use regexp here: `generated.*`, regexp is applied on full path.
  # Default value is empty list,
  # but default dirs are skipped independently of this option's value (see skip-dirs-use-default).
  # "/" will be replaced by current OS file path separator to properly work on Windows.
  #skip-dirs:
  #  - src/external_libs
  #  - autogenerated_by_my_lib

  # Enables skipping of directories:
  # - vendor$, third_party$, testdata$, examples$, Godeps$, builtin$
  # Default: true
  #skip-dirs-use-default: false

  # Which files to skip: they will be analyzed, but issues from them won't be reported.
  # Default value is empty list,
  # but there is no need to include all autogenerated files,
  # we confidently recognize autogenerated files.
  # If it's not please let us know.
  # "/" will be replaced by current OS file path separator to properly work on Windows.
  #skip-files:
  #  - ".*\\.my\\.go$"
  #  - lib/bad.go

  # If set we pass it to "go list -mod={option}". From "go help modules":
  # If invoked with -mod=readonly, the go command is disallowed from the implicit
  # automatic updating of go.mod described above. Instead, it fails when any changes
  # to go.mod are needed. This setting is most useful to check that go.mod does
  # not need updates, such as in a continuous integration and testing system.
  # If invoked with -mod=vendor, the go command assumes that the vendor
  # directory holds the correct copies of dependencies and ignores
  # the dependency descriptions in go.mod.
  #
  # Allowed values: readonly|vendor|mod
  # By default, it isn't set.
  #modules-download-mode: readonly

  # Allow multiple parallel golangci-lint instances running.
  # If false (default) - golangci-lint acquires file lock on start.
  allow-parallel-runners: false

  # Define the Go version limit.
  # Mainly related to generics support in go1.18.
  # Default: use Go version from the go.mod file, fallback on the env var `GOVERSION`, fallback on 1.17
  #go: '1.18'


# output configuration options
output:

  # for each of them by separating format name and path by colon symbol.
  # Output path can be either `stdout`, `stderr` or path to the file to write to.
