# This script is a wrapper for the skopeo command.
#
# skopeo is invoked from the kata-agent process, which runs as a systemd service defined
# in /etc/systemd/system/kata-agent.service. This systemd service launches kata-agent in 
# a newly created network namespace called "netns".  This network namespace is connected to
# Kubernetes pod network, not host network of the pod VM. The skopeo command is used to 
# pull images from remote container registries, and requires network access when pulling
# images. When network accesses to remote registries are restricted by some mechanisms such 
# as iptables, the skopeo command fails to pull images, and kata-agent fails to create
# containers.
#
# To work around this issue, this wrapper script launches the skopeo command in the the network
# namespace of the process with PID 1, which is usually the systemd process.
#
# TODO: If kata-agent has a mechanism to create a new network namespace in addition to other
# network namespace such as mount and PID namespaces, we can remote this wrapper script by using
# that mechanism.

exec nsenter --target 1 --net /usr/local/bin/skopeo.bin "$@"
